# pacmen

## Description
This is a programming exercise that is a spin-off of the classic Pac-Man game. In this version, the user can add any number of Pac-Men to the screen by repeatedly clicking the "Add Pac-Man" button. Each new Pac-Man is placed on the screen with a randomized direction of travel. Also, each Pac-Man is randomly assigned a velocity at which he moves across the screen.

Beyond these basic requirements for this exercise, I also enabled the physical rotation of each Pac-Man based upon its direction of travel. Upon bouncing off of the screen boundaries, each Pac-Man will automatically rotate to face its new direction of travel. Additionally, I created the chomping animation for the Pac-Men, and each Pac-Man chomps at a rate that is relative/proportional to its directional velocity.

I also styled the screen to mimic the actual Pac-Man game, by giving it a black background with blue accents. In addition to the basic "Add Pac-Man" and "Start Game" buttons, you will also find functional buttons for "Pause Game", which temporarily pauses the motion of all Pac-Men until clicking the "Start Game" button again, and "Clear Game", which permanently stops all animation and also deletes all Pac-Men.

## Roadmap
- I would like to add little dots across the entire game screen, either placed randomly or in a grid pattern, for the Pac-Men to chomp and eat.
